/**
 * TODO: 
 * 		- Define a class Car in this file below these comments.
 * 		-  Provide the private instance variable mileage of type double
 *			-  Provide a constructor 
 *				public Car(String make, String model, int year, double mileage)
 *               This initializes the instance variables. 
 *			Provide a getter function for  mileage
 *			Provide a print() that overrides that of the parent class- prints 
 *			the vehicle make, model and year. then displays the mileage in the NEXT line as "Mileage: 12000.0"
 *			where mileage=12000.0 in the above example.  
 *
 * NOTE: You do not need to do error checking. You can assume that the values 
 * of mileage for testing will be non-negative.
